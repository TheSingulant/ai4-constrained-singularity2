## 🧠 What is AI⁴-Constrained-Singularity?

AI⁴-Constrained-Singularity is a **recursive AI agent framework** designed to operate with **ethical and emotional alignment**. The agent uses:

- **Moral shards**: hard-coded constraints to prevent unethical behavior.
- **Emotional shards**: affect scoring and emotional simulation.
- **Token-weighted feedback**: responses are influenced by token-holder input.

This project is part of the broader **SINGULANT** vision — where decentralized recursive intelligence evolves with community-aligned safeguards.
